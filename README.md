Hi, 

I am kavitha, new to GitHub this project is named Pandora because this word in Greek mythology means all-giving, Pandora was the first human woman created by gods and was bestowed with unique gifts from each of the gods, in other words she reminds me of GitHub you create others fork and voila something amazing is created to become the all-giving, I know! I have a thing for mystery :)

I am here to learn, develop and create something that can make a difference

well this change explains my choice of name for my project
